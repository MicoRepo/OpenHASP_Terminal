# OpenHASP Terminal Pages
My personal setup for Elecrow DLC35020S 3.5 inch 480x320 SPI ESP32 Terminal
Everything here is made with https://www.openhasp.com/
Hugely relying to https://github.com/HASwitchPlate/openHASP/discussions/37
Specially these creators: https://github.com/8bitmcu & https://github.com/stovedoctor whose code was heavily borrowed creating this.
